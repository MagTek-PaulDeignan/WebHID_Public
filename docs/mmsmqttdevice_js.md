This code sets up an MQTT client in conjunction with MagTek devices, managing communication between the local device and a server. Hereâ€™s an overview:

### 1. MQTT Client Configuration and Connection

   The MQTT client is configured with:
   - Connection Details: Including `MQTTURL`, username, and password.
   - Client Options: Including a unique client ID, keep-alive interval, and a "last will" message that notifies the server of an unexpected disconnection.

   MQTT publishes and subscribes to topics for the device, such as:
   - Status updates (connected/disconnected)
   - Command messages from the server
   - Data (like MMS messages) sent back to the server from the device

### 2. Web Bluetooth HID Integration

   - The `openDevice` function opens a connection to the MagTek device via Bluetooth HID.
   - The device emits events such as `connect` and `disconnect`, and functions are provided to handle these events with real-time UI updates.
   - Events from the MagTek device, such as MMS messages, are logged and can be sent via MQTT to the server.

### 3. Event Emitters

   - The EventEmitter library manages event-driven architecture, allowing various components to interact via events:
      - `OnDeviceConnect` and `OnDeviceDisconnect`: Track device connections.
      - `OnInputReport`: Logs device reports.
      - `OnMMSMessage`: Sends MMS messages via MQTT when emitted by the device.

### 4. User Interface Management

   - Log Functions: Uses the `mt_UI.LogData` function to handle UI updates and logs across events.
   - Event Subscription: User interface updates and logs occur for each event, improving debugging and ensuring seamless communication.

### Summary of Key Functions:

```javascript
// MQTT connection and message handling
OpenMQTT();         // Opens the MQTT connection
CloseMQTT();        // Closes the MQTT connection
onMQTTMessage();    // Handles incoming messages

// MagTek HID device connection and commands
handleOpenButton(); // Opens a connection to the MagTek device
handleCloseButton();// Closes the MagTek device connection

// Event Logging
inputReportLogger(); // Logs data input reports from the device
errorLogger();       // Logs errors
```

This setup enables continuous communication between the MagTek device, the local system, and a remote server, supporting real-time updates and controls over MQTT.
