## HTML Structure

### Header Section

The header includes the MagTek logo and the title of the application:

```html
<div class="container">
  <a href="index.html">
    <img src="./images/magtek_logo.png" alt="Logo" width="150">
  </a>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <h1>WebSocket MMS Demo</h1>
</div>
```

### Main Body

#### USB Connection Status

Displays the USB connection status using an image and text indicator:

```html
<img id="USBStatus" src="./images/usb-disconnected.png">
<span id="lblUSBStatus">Disconnected</span>
```

#### Device Controls

Buttons for managing the device connection:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="deviceOpen">Open</button>
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="deviceClose">Close</button>
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="clearCommand">Clear</button>
```

#### Command Data Input and Processing

Input field and button for sending commands to the device:

```html
<input type="text" class="form-control" name="sendData" id="sendData">
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="sendCommand">Send Command</button>
```

#### Command List Dropdown

Dropdown menu with pre-defined commands:

```html
<select class="form-control-3" name="CommandList" id="CommandList">
  <option value="SENDCOMMAND,AA008104010010018430100182013CA30981010182010183010184020003861A9C01009F02060000000001009F03060000000000005F2A020840">START EMV</option>
  <option value="SENDCOMMAND,AA0081040113100884021008">CANCEL EMV</option>
  <option value="SENDCOMMAND,AA00810401121F0184021F01">Reset Device</option>
  <option value="SENDCOMMAND,AA0081040155D101840FD1018501018704020701028902C100">Get User Notify</option>
  <!-- Additional options here -->
</select>
```

## Key Functionalities

### USB Connection Status

Displays the real-time status of the USB connection using an image and label. The status updates dynamically based on the device state.

### Device Controls

- Open: Initiates the connection to the device.
- Close: Terminates the connection.
- Clear: Clears the logs and input fields.

### Command Data Input and Processing

Users can input custom commands into the `sendData` field and execute them using the "Send Command" button. The results appear in the log section.

### Command List Dropdown

Provides pre-defined commands for common device operations such as starting EMV, canceling EMV, and resetting the device.

## JavaScript Implementation

### WebSocket Communication

The `Demo_mmsWebSocket.js` file establishes and manages WebSocket connections, allowing multiple concurrent connections as per the pre-defined commands.

#### Example Commands for WebSocket Connections

- Set WebSocket Connections to 1:
  ```javascript
  SENDCOMMAND,AA0081040155D1118410D1118501018704020201018903CA0101
  ```

- Set WebSocket Connections to 4:
  ```javascript
  SENDCOMMAND,AA0081040155D1118410D1118501018704020201018903CA0104
  ```

### Command Handling

The WebSocket commands are processed through a robust handler that supports:

- Sending commands
- Managing device state transitions
- Handling responses asynchronously

#### Example Command Handling Logic

- Send Command:
  ```javascript
  function sendCommand(command) {
    // Logic to send a WebSocket command to the device
  }
  ```

- Handle WebSocket Connection Change:
  ```javascript
  function setWebSocketConnections(connectionCount) {
    // Logic to adjust the number of WebSocket connections
  }
  ```

## Event Handling

### Subscribed Events

Event listeners provide real-time feedback on device interactions, including input reports, barcode detection, contactless events, and errors.

#### Example Events

- OnDeviceConnect: Triggered when a device is connected.
  ```javascript
  EventEmitter.on("OnDeviceConnect", (e) => {
    mt_UI.setUSBConnected("Connected");
  });
  ```

- OnContactlessCardDetected: Triggered when a contactless card is detected.
  ```javascript
  EventEmitter.on("OnContactlessCardDetected", async (e) => {
    mt_UI.LogData(`Contactless Card Detected`);
  });
  ```

- OnError: Captures error details.
  ```javascript
  EventEmitter.on("OnError", (e) => {
    mt_UI.LogData(`Error: ${e.Source} ${JSON.stringify(e.Data)}`);
  });
  ```
