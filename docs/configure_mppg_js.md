This JavaScript module provides an interface for configuring user settings for the MagTek MPPG application. It utilizes the mt_utils module to retrieve and store default values for essential fields such as username, password, customer code, and processor name.

### Key Components and Functionality

1. Event Listeners:
   - `DOMContentLoaded`: Initializes the form by populating fields with existing settings or default values when the page loads.
   - `btnSave` and `btnBack`: Handle interactions for saving data and returning to the main page, respectively.

2. Form Initialization (`handleDOMLoaded`):
   - Retrieves and displays saved values or defaults for MPPG-specific fields:
     - Username (`MPPG_UserName`)
     - Password (`MPPG_Password`)
     - Customer Code (`MPPG_CustCode`)
     - Processor Name (`MPPG_ProcessorName`)
   - These fields are used for authentication and identification within the MPPG system.

3. Navigation Handling:
   - Back Button (`handleBackButton`): Redirects to the homepage or main page.
   
4. Save Functionality (`handleSaveButton`):
   - Saves each field value using `mt_Utils.saveDefaultValue`, which updates the settings in local storage or a configuration.
   - Displays a "Saved" status to confirm the action.
   - Redirects back to the homepage after saving.

### Example Workflow

1. On Load: Populates fields with either saved values or default values.
2. User Updates Fields: Inputs new values in the form fields.
3. Save Settings:
   - Upon clicking "Save," the `handleSaveButton` saves each value and provides feedback by displaying a "Saved" message.
4. Redirect: After saving, the user is redirected to the main page.

### Summary

This module simplifies credential management by saving and retrieving critical MPPG configuration data, enhancing the user experience with feedback and navigation features. This setup ensures consistent credentials and allows seamless transitions within the application.
