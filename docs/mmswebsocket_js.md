This JavaScript module introduces WebSocket (WS) connectivity for managing MagTek devices through command handling and event-driven responses. Here’s an overview of the components and workflows:

### Core Features

1. WebSocket Communication
   - WebSocket Address Configuration: Uses `wsAddress` to specify the WebSocket endpoint.
   - OpenWS / CloseWS: Manages WebSocket connections, opening and closing them based on the current WebSocket state.
   - SendCommand: Sends commands through WebSocket to communicate with the connected device.

2. WebSocket Event Handlers
   - `ws_onopen`: Logs a successful connection and updates the UI.
   - `ws_onerror`: Handles and logs WebSocket errors.
   - `ws_onmessage`: Receives and processes incoming messages, parsing them into appropriate formats and passing them for further handling.
   - `ws_onclose`: Logs and manages WebSocket closure, including UI updates.

3. Device Command Handling
   - parseCommand: Parses commands for operations like retrieving app version, sending commands, and handling devices.
   - Auto-Start: Detects certain card actions (e.g., contactless card detection) and initiates corresponding commands automatically when specific conditions are met.
   
4. Event-Driven Logging and Display
   - Custom event loggers for diverse device events, including:
     - Contactless Card Events: Logs and manages actions when cards are detected, inserted, or removed.
     - Error Handling: Centralized error logging and reporting for debugging.
     - ARQC and Batch Data: Parses and logs specific ARQC (Authorization Request Cryptogram) and batch data for tracking transaction events.

5. UI Integration
   - The module utilizes `mt_UI` to update the user interface dynamically, managing device state (e.g., "Connected," "Disconnected") and displaying key information.
   - Real-Time Logging: Logs activities in the UI, providing a live status view of operations, responses, and errors.

### Sample Workflow

1. Device Connection
   - The user clicks Open Device to establish a WebSocket connection. The system logs the connection state and starts listening for device events.
  
2. Automatic Transaction Handling
   - Upon detection of a contactless card, the system initiates a command automatically if configured.
   - Events like `OnContactCardInserted` trigger actions based on the auto-start conditions set in the UI.

3. Error Management
   - Errors encountered during WebSocket operations or device commands are logged and displayed to the user, allowing for immediate visibility and debugging.

### Summary

This module supports interactive device management over WebSocket, handling commands, real-time logging, and automated responses to specific events. It’s designed for ease of integration with a UI, providing a smooth interface for monitoring device status and activity.
