This module provides functionality for managing MagTek devices, configuring settings, and handling various command operations through UI interactions.

### Network Configuration

1. IP and Addressing Modes
   - getDeviceIP: Retrieves the current IP address of the device.
   - getAddressMode / setAddressMode: Gets and sets the deviceâ€™s address mode (e.g., DHCP).

2. SSID Management
   - getSSID: Fetches the SSID currently configured on the device.
   - setSSID / setSSIDPassword: Allows users to set the SSID and its password, enabling device connectivity to Wi-Fi networks.

3. Security Mode
   - getWireLessSecurityMode and setWireLessSecurityPSKMode: Configure the wireless security mode (e.g., PSK for Wi-Fi security).

4. TLS Loading
   - LoadTLS / LoadNoTLS: These functions send commands to configure the device with or without TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensuring secure data transmission.

5. Device Reset
   - ResetDevice: Resets the device to restart operations or clear settings.

### Command Handling and Event-driven Updates

1. Command Handling
   - parseCommand: Handles command parsing, allowing users to retrieve device info, send commands, and parse responses.
   - Command-specific Logging: Each command provides detailed logging to help with debugging and status tracking.

2. Event Logging and Automation
   - Custom Event Loggers: Logs key data from events like `OnContactlessCardDetected`, `OnDeviceResponse`, and `OnError`.
   - Automated Device Interaction: Monitors contactless and MSR interactions and triggers actions like auto-starting transactions based on user settings (e.g., enabling auto-start for EMV cards).

3. UI and Display
   - Dynamic Logging: Uses `mt_UI.LogData` to print log messages directly to the interface, allowing real-time monitoring.
   - Device Display: Shows messages directly on the device display for certain events (e.g., `OnUIDisplayMessage`).

### Example Workflow

1. Setting Up Device and Network Configuration
   - The user can open the device connection, configure SSID and password, and check the device IP. The device can be reset if needed.

2. Transaction Processing and Event Handling
   - When a contactless card is detected, the auto-start function begins a transaction if configured. Events are logged for debugging, and errors are handled appropriately.

### Summary

This code is designed to provide a robust solution for managing MagTek devices over a network, setting up security configurations, and handling device events in real-time. It allows users to configure network settings programmatically and monitor device activities through a UI, making it a powerful tool for interactive and automated device management.
